# Patient Data Sovereignty - 2025  

Patient data sovereignty is the cornerstone of healthcare innovation in 2025. It empowers individuals to control how their health data is collected, stored, and used, shifting power from centralized entities to patients themselves. By ensuring transparency, privacy, and consent, data sovereignty enables patients to actively participate in the healthcare ecosystem while maintaining ownership of their information.  

This repository represents the first step in building a verifiable health data lifecycle, starting with a rare disease example to demonstrate the modelâ€™s potential. De-identified patient data is securely shared with researchers, enabling breakthroughs without compromising privacy.  

As data becomes a driving force for medical advancements, patient data sovereignty ensures ethical use, fosters trust, and creates a future where healthcare is more transparent, collaborative, and patient-driven.
