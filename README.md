Historic Genetic Metabolic Data Registry
Informed Consent
The Historic Genetic Metabolic ("HGM") data registry collects information from existing biobanks and labs to provide researchers access to the reliable data they need to better understand and treat this spectrum of disorders.

A rare disease registry collects and stores medical and other information from individuals with the same disease. A biobank is a place that stores tissue, blood, or other samples. Registries and biobanks often work together to share information.

Metabolic patients have sampled and tracked for years and have an opportunity to harness that data so that researchers have better information to understand the disorders and develop new treatments.

The rarity and variety of genetic metabolic mutations have made it hard to address with traditional clinical research methods.

Today's technologies give us the opportunity to put the power of data to work finding breakthroughs.

How does the HGM registry work?
De-identified information regarding your genetic metabolic treatment history will be included in a secure database that will be used for medical research and experimental clinical trials. The purpose of the registry is to better understand rare diseases and to develop new treatments. The registry also addresses other critical needs like the turnaround of testing results and the distribution of treatments.

Scientists will access the HGM registry in order to find accurate information to understand how genetic metabolic disorders affect people. In addition, scientists who want to start studies, such as testing new treatments, will need access to the HGM registry to locate people who may be eligible to participate in studies.
